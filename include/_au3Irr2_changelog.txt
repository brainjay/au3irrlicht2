; au3Irrlicht2 Changelog
; ======================
; this file is used to create history of help file. So it need to be well formated:
; empty lines or lines with leading ';' are ignored
; '=' in row1 defines header for release information (all '=' are removed for .html): 
; = [release number] ([date info]) ===========
; First found release info is also used to update the static introduction .html
; lines with '>' in row start a header
; lines with '+' in row start a list point in .html (with a bullet)
; lines with '-' in row start an ignored list point (history details not interesting for normal users)
; all following indented lines (starting in row >= 3) belong to the current .html or ignored list point
; '[' and ']' can be used to set text to bold in .html

> UDFs:

+ Fixed/Added: _IrrGetSphericalTerrainSurfacePositionAndAngle
+ Fixed/Added: _IrrGetSphericalTerrainLogicalSurfacePosition
+ Fixed/Added: _IrrGetSphericalTerrainSurfacePosition
- Tidy: au3Irr2_System.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_Particles.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_Materials.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_GUI.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_Collision.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_KeyboardMouse.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_FilingSystem.au3 error return
- Tidy: au3Irr2_Lighting.au3 error return  
- Tidy: au3Irr2_Scene.au3 error return.
- Tidy: au3Irr2_Terrain.au3 error returns.
- Changed: parameter names for _IrrSetLightAttenuation.
  Looking at the wrapper reference docs the parameters are Red, Green, Blue.
  Looking at the wrapper source the values are Constant, Linear, Quadratic.
  This parameter name change won't affect how the function works but
  at least it may give some indication of what the parameters actually affect.
- Changed: parameter $f_Y to $f_Z in _IrrGetTerrainHeight, _IrrGetTerrainTileHeight
  These functions use X and Z as input parameters and not X and Y as previously shown.
- Changed: _IrrSetSphericalTerrainTexture 6 face texture paramater names from
  $s_XXX to $h_XXX, Changed "str" to "ptr" in 6 instances for the DllCall.
- Changed: _IrrLoadSphericalTerrainVertexColor 6 face image paramater names from
  $s_XXX to $h_XXX, changed "str" to "ptr" in 6 instances for the DllCall.
  


> Examples:

+ Added: 071 (Sphere_Terrain_Surface), 096 (LightingAndShadowMaps)
- Changed: 031 (Loading_Scene) for example.irr scene from irrlicht-1.7.1 sdk.
  (The scene shows the potential of IrrLicht a bit better)



> Help file:

- Added: more examples for help file, _IrrSetSphericalTerrainTexture, 
  _IrrAreNodesIntersecting, _IrrGetDistanceBetweenNodes, _IrrIsPointInsideNode,
  _IrrGetSphericalTerrainSurfacePositionAndAngle, _IrrGetSphericalTerrainLogicalSurfacePosition,
  _IrrGetSphericalTerrainSurfacePosition, _IrrSetLightAmbientColor, _IrrSetLightRadius,
  _IrrSetCameraFOV, _IrrScaleMesh, _IrrGetCollisionNodeFromCamera, _IrrLoadScene
- Added: more header info for functions in au3Irr2_Scene.au3	
- Added: more header info for functions in au3Irr2_Terrain.au3
- Added: more header info for functions in au3Irr2_Lighting.au3
- Added function header info in au3Irr2_FilingSystem.au3



> Other:

+ Added: Tools\FontTool.exe (used for creating bmp fonts, comes from IrrLicht 1.7.1 sdk) 
- Changed: global $result is no longer used and has been removed from au3Irr2_Constants.au3
- Added: example.zip to \media directory (for Load Scene examples, 200KB in size)
- Removed: SimpleScene.irr from \media directory as it's no longer needed.
- Moved: FontTool.exe, FontTool.txt to \Bin directory and removed \Tools directory 
=== 2.04 (2010-10-09) ==========================================================



> Script breaking changes:

+ _IrrAddSplineAnimator: Parameters changed to simplify usage (see examples)
+ _IrrGetNodePosition, _IrrGetNodeRotation, _IrrGetNodeAbsolutePosition,
  _IrrGetCameraTarget: Removed required byRef array parameter
  (see help file/adjusted examples for syntax)



> UDFs:

+ Fixed/Added: Some more working functions (mainly around added examples)
+ Added: Some missing 2D functions and documentation (contributions from smashly)
+ Fixed: _IrrSetFog (linear and exponential fog were interchanged)
+ Fixed: _IrrCreateMesh ($s_MeshName not being passed in the DLL call)
- Fixed: wrong return type in _IrrWriteMesh - "ptr:cdecl" is now "int:cdecl"
  Also reworked returned error codes
- _IrrSetZoneManagerBoundingBox, _IrrSetZoneManagerProperties:
  changed "ptr:cdecl" to "none:cdecl" as this dllcall doesn't offer a return.
- _IrrSetSkyDomeColor, _IrrSetSkyDomeColorBand, _IrrSetSkyDomeColorPoint, _IrrAnimateJoints: 
  changed "ptr:cdecl" to "none:cdecl" as this dllcall doesn't offer a return by call.
  These dll calls outputs printf errors straight to console.
+ Fixed: _IrrGetScreenCoordinatesFrom3DPosition (did not return anything useable because of wrong dllCall)



> Examples:

+ Added: 015 (CustomMesh), 022 (Indices+Vertices), 024 (Mesh to file), 062 (6D0F_Camera)
+ Added: (contribution from smashly): 039 (Texture blending), 070 (Texture_and_Images), 103 (Billboard Groups), 104 (LOD)
+ Added: 007/025/027/066/067/068/069/074/075 (ParticleSystem)
+ Reworked: 011 (Animators) shows usage of changed _IrrAddSplineAnimator
+ Fixed: 010 (TerrainAndFog) / 029/054 (Skydomes)
- 010: Corrected parameters and wrong documentation of _IrrSetFog. 029/054: renamed 
  skydome.jpg to 'skydome2.jpg' and restored original texture needed for example 054.



> Help file:

+ Added: Completed documentation including example code for some more functions.
  Current status: Topics completed along examples 1-16 + several more.
  At least naked reference w/o detailed informations for all functions inside other examples.
- Changed: Reworked several help file descriptions and examples.
+ Added: 'Copy to clipboard'-button for included examples (using VBS code from GEOSoft)



> Internal tools:

- Fixed: help_tool.au3 - added functions in UDFs w/o info block were not updated correctly.
+ Fixed: Examples could not be opened when running launcher from path with spaces
+ Added: Setup feature to example launcher to merge au3Irr2 help into local au3 help 
  and add/update calltips for SciTe
- calltip file and merged autoIt.chm are compiled into exampleLauncher.exe, so removed from root dir
+ Excluded \internal_tools because not too interesting for 99.9% (for the 0.1%: available via the 
  sources from project page)


> Other:
+ Changed: global $result used in UDF files switched to local variables (WIP, finished for 2D, Scene, 
  Camera, Animation, Node)


=== 2.03 (2010-09-05) ==========================================================

> UDF:

+ Changed: Splitted UDF per category into \include. Main UDF (and the only one which is
  needed to be included) is still au3Irrlicht2.au3
+ Changed: All used dll files are moved to \bin to clean up the root dir.
  _IrrStart is modified to find them anyway.
+ Fixed: _IrrSetNodeVisibility

> Examples:

+ Added: 089 (Orthogonal Camera), 106 (Advanced start)
+ Changed: 029 (Skydome)
+ Fixed: 049 (Loaded_Scene_Collision), 051 (Clouds)

> Help file:

+ Added: First version as reference of all working + proven functions. Current status:
  Topics completed including example code along examples 1 to 6.
  Naked reference w/o detailed informations for other examples.
+ Changed: Moved original freeBasic Wrapper docs from \FB_documentation to 
  \internal_tools\buildHelp\html_static. It's now included into help file.
+ Added: Merged help to use the au3Irr2 help inside the au3 help.

> Internal tools:

+ Added: helper scripts and files for building help file and au3.user.calltips.api
  (see [\internal tools\help_building_readme.txt]) 


> Other:

+ Added: msvcr71.dll - possibly missing on some machines ([jl])
