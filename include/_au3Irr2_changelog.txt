; au3Irrlicht2 Changelog
; ======================
; this file is used to create history of help file. So it need to be well formated:
; empty lines or lines with leading ';' are ignored
; '=' in row1 defines header for release information (all '=' are removed for .html): 
; = [release number] ([date info]) ===========
; First found release info is also used to update the static introduction .html
; lines with '>' in row start a header
; lines with '+' in row start a list point in .html (with a bullet)
; lines with '-' in row start an ignored list point (history details not interesting for normal users)
; all following indented lines (starting in row >= 3) belong to the current .html or ignored list point
; '[' and ']' can be used to set text to bold in .html
