==========

Replaced Irrlicht.dll and IrrlichtWrapper.dll with re-compiled and re-patched builds (on top of Irrlicht 1.8 / Visual Studio 2012 Express):
- Replaced fonttool.exe with build from Irrlicht 1.8
- removed msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll (as they should no longer be needed)

- dropped support for DX8 (not worth to compile Irrlicht.dll with it)
  A: to be merged into help files

- currently not working: particle examples / XEffects examples ()
  A: check patched irrlicht source
  particles: example 007: _IrrSetNodeMaterialType ( $SmokeParticles, $IRR_EMT_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA ) <<< works with $IRR_EMT_SOLID! 
  
  shader: glsl vs. hlsl (dx?)
  
Win7/64
- A: check support/required changes (e.g. in Setup of Example launcher, Useability after typical installation of AU3

Rift
- A: check how implementation of Rift SDK could be done

Sound
- A: also re-compile Irrklang and IrrklangWrapper. Possible to merge IrklangWrapper to IrrlichtWrapper?
- A: check if 3D-sound can be added to a node (additional func in Wrapper)
