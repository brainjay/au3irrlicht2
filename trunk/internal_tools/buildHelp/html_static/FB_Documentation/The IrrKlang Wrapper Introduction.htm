<span style="font-weight: bold;">MP3 Licensing Issues:</span> This
package does not include the MP3 plugin module required to play MP3
sound files (although you can download IrrKlang and copy the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ikpMP3.dll</span>
into your IrrKlangWrapper directory for full MP3 support). A large
number of companies have claimed ownership of patents nessecary to
implement MP3 and Thompson Consumer Electronics in particular has been
activlty enforcing those patents (although they themselves have also
been subject to lawsuites alledging IP infringment) &nbsp;These patents
do not expire until 2012 at the earliest and possibly 2017 if some
questionable claims can be enforced. To avoid problems my personal
recommendation is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">use the Open Source Patent free OGG Vorbis format</span> that delievers comparable or superior quality and performance <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">http://www.vorbis.com/</a>.<br>
</span>

<br>


The first thing I must do
is acknowledge
the fantastic work that has been carried out by the many different
authors whos amazing work makes it possible for this package to enable
BASIC programmers to easily incorporate audio and manage the sound
system for a complete multi-media application.
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This wrapper library
provides a <span style="font-weight: bold;">simple</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">partial</span>
gateway from non object-oriented
languages like <span style="font-weight: bold;">FreeBasic</span>
into the object oriented audio engine <span style="font-weight: bold;">IrrKlang</span>.
Although the wrapper only exposes part of the
functionality of IrrKlang it endevours to expose the most important
parts to give you access to IrrKlangs powerful features. It does not
directly expose the IrrKlang commands but provides a seperate syntax
to encapsulate the engine. </p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In total it provides
over 20 commands that
cover streaming and memory playback of&nbsp;2D and 3D sounds.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This document serves
as an
introduction
into the wrapper, from here I suggest you follow the installation
instructions below and then try out the examples, these practical
demonstrations provide an excellent way to learn how the wrapper
functions. If you need specific information your first port of call
will be the reference manual and your last port of call the&nbsp;<b><i>IrrKlangWrapper.bi</i></b>
which hopefully you will not need.</p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>


      
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The installation of
the
IrrKklangWrapper for FreeBasic package is very simple, just extract the
zip file to a folder of your choice and your ready to go. You may
prefer to&nbsp;move the <b><i>IrrKlangWrapper.bi</i></b>
file to
your <b><i>FreeBasic\inc </i></b>directory
however I leave it where it is and create my project files within the
same directory.
The wrapper uses a standard IrrKlang DLL and as such you can import any
IrrKlang DLL you wish to use however this library was built with a
specific version of IrrKlang and newer versions may not operate as
expected.</p>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: You will need
FreeBasic verion 0.20 or better to use the wrapper</span>
      
      <h2>The Audio Engine</h2>


When you start Irrlicht
with the <b><i>IrrKlangStart</i></b> command
you create an object that manages your loaded library of sounds, it
provides commands that allow you to control the playback of those
sounds and to free them up to release memory for other things you may
wish to load.</td>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="center"><img style="width: 256px; height: 256px;" alt="" src="media/diagram.jpg"><br>

<h2>The Sound Object</h2>


A sound object is an audio file that may be a WAV sample. MP3 Music and
even some tracker modules.<br>


<br>


The sound object is stored in main memory and can be used to create a
momentary sound effect such as walking feet or the roar of a beast, or
it can be used in a looped mannar to create ambient background sound or
to play a musical track.<br>


<br>


When you load a new sound the wrapper will return the object to you as
an <b><i>irr_sound </i></b>type <span style="font-weight: bold;">only if you set the track
parameter to true</span>, otherwise it will return an empty
object to you that you cannot use later. If you have a large number of
sounds you should store the sound objects and remove them from memory
when they are no longer needed.<br>
